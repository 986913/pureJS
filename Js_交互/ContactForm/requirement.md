Building forms is a common task in Front End. In this exercise, we will build a basic "Contact Us" form, commonly seen on marketing websites for visitors to ask questions or provide feedback.

Requirements:

The form should contain the following elements: Name field, Email field, Message field,Submit button that contains the text "Sent" and clicking on the submit button submits the form.

The form and submission should be implemented entirely in HTML. No JavaScript should be used for this question.

There is no need to do any validation on the fields. Validation will be done on the server side.

Submission API:

Upon submission, POST the form data to https://www.greatfrontend.com/api/questions/contact-formwith the following fields in the request body: name, email, message.

If all the form fields are filled up, you will see an alert containing a success message. Congratulations!
